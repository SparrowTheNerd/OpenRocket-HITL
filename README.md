# OpenRocket-HITL
An OpenRocket simulation extension aimed at SITL and HITL testing for my WINTER flight computer and under-development EKF.

## Note:
Relies on my fork of OpenRocket which has body acceleration exports and a fix for body rotation rates. These changes will hopefully be included in the base OR repo soon!
